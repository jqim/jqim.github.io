<h2>Solutions Overview</h2>

<p>Single-dealer platforms have become an indispensable channel to market for any bank offering electronic trading services. The Caplin solution is highly scalable and performant; it uses best of breed technologies at each level - where they already existed we used, enhanced or extended them, and where they didn&#39;t exist, we&#39;ve built them.</p>

<p>The Caplin Motifs are executable front-end interfaces with an elegant user experience that you can integrate with your existing trading systems. It&#39;s equipped with all the essential functionality you need to deliver trading execution functionality.</p>

<p>Caplin solutions are based on the best ideas from the most successful trading GUIs &ndash; ready-to-go, right out of the box. They are infinitely customisable, allowing you to create exactly the functionality and user experience that you require. By having suite of pre-built solutions it reduces the overall time to market for an in-house built single-dealer platform from 1-2 years to 3-4 months, and reduces the overall cost by 75% or more.</p>

<p>The Caplin FX Motif is built entirely using HTML5 and is provided as source code so that you can change, rewrite or extend any of it. It is easy to embed as a seamless part of a multi-asset offering. Our Professional Services team is always available to work with you to specify, project manage and develop your own unique trading app.</p>

				<h2>Foreign Exchange</h2>

<p>To compete successfully in today&rsquo;s FX markets, you need to deliver a great trading experience to your clients and employees.</p>

<p>Caplin helps you to achieve this quickly and cost-effectively. We&rsquo;ve solved the big technical challenges of advanced online trading, leaving you free to concentrate on your business. The Caplin Platform integrates with your existing systems and delivers powerful information and execution capabilities to users of all types, both inside and outside the firm.</p>

<p>Years of experience have gone into designing a range of precise workflows tuned to the needs of key user segments. We have ready-made offerings for both desktop and mobile devices, and these can be branded, styled, customised and extended without limit. So you get to market fast with trading offerings that attract clients, project your key strengths and differentiate you from the competition.</p>

<p>The Caplin Platform is designed for use across all asset classes and with all types of information. Powerful integration tools make it easy to add your own content (such as news, analysis, trade ideas, instant messaging) as well as any other products you choose.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve helped banks ranging from global giants like Citi and Barclays to regional leaders like Standard Bank and Unicredit to deliver a unique online trading service that meets their exact needs. We can help you too.</p>

<p><strong>Caplin offers four FX solutions.</strong></p>

<div class="row">
<div class="one-half">
<h2>FX Corporate</h2>

<p>Corporate treasurers, payments clerks and other accounting staff from small enterprises to larger corporations need to manage their company&rsquo;s FX exposure. Conventional FX trading screens designed for professional or retail traders do not make this easy, and often fail to meet basic corporate governance requirements.</p>

<p>Caplin FX Corporate supports real corporate treasurer workflows - vital to retaining existing clients and attracting new ones, and incentivising migration from high-cost voice channels to low-cost online trading. And all whilst meeting&nbsp;the increasing needs of corporate governance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Who is it for?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>For payments clerks who need to make FX transactions to cover foreign payments.</li>
	<li>For corporate treasurers who take a view on the market so they can manage their risk and cash flow with hedging.</li>
</ul>

<p>The power of Caplin Trader allows the FX Corporate Motif to be fully customised. This can be from simple branding and restyling, to a complete redesign or even developing new workflows and integrating new content.</p>
</div>

<div class="one-half"><img alt="" src="../images/marketing-images/v3/corp.jpg" style="max-width: 800px; max-height: 527px;" /></div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="one-half"><img alt="" src="../images/marketing-images/v3/sales_1.png" style="max-width: 831px; max-height: 566px;" /></div>

<div class="one-half">
<h2>FX Sales</h2>

<p>Your FX Sales people need to be able to trade on behalf of clients, maintain real-time control of margins, and access client information instantly. Most conventional systems require them to access multiple screens to achieve this.</p>

<p>With Caplin FX Sales your people can service their customers using efficient workflows, whether they are reacting to customer demands or being proactive. And you have the added advantage that you can track, monitor and analyse all their sales activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Who is it for?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Provide your FX sales team with complete control over client trades and put client information at their fingertips.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="one-half">
<h2>FX Professional</h2>

<p>Professional traders demand tight consistent pricing, and low rejection rates if they are to be persuaded to use your trading offering. Conventional trading screens often fall short of the mark, with lack of support for many different trading styles, or integrated pre-trade tools.</p>

<p>Caplin FX Professional provides full order functionality, responsive screen interaction, and rich pre-trade content including research, news and charting as well as post- trade position/order management.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div class="one-half"><img alt="" src="../images/marketing-images/v3/professional_1.png" style="max-width: 750px; max-height: 527px;" /></div>

<div class="row">
<div class="one-half"><img alt="" src="../images/marketing-images/v3/mobile_1.png" style="max-width: 762px; max-height: 446px;" /></div>

<div class="one-half">
<h2>FX Mobile</h2>

<p>Professional traders, corporate clients and your own traders all need to keep an eye on markets and positions while on the move. Increasingly they also want to react to these by trading and managing orders when away from their desks..</p>

<p>Caplin FX Mobile lets you offer your clients powerful risk management tools on mobile devices. They can monitor positions and proactively manage FX exposures in response to market events. They can instantly create new orders and execute trades - with everything seamlessly connected to the same information they have on their desktop.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Who is it for?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Provide corporate clients with the ability to manage their risk and exposure.</li>
	<li>Give professional trading clients the ability to trade whenever and wherever they are.</li>
	<li>Allow your internal traders to keep up to date with the latest rates and manage their positions when away from their desk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>

				<div class="row">
<div class="one-half"><img alt="" src="../images/marketing-images/v3/equities-solutions.png" style="max-width: 1382px; max-height: 611px;" /></div>

<div class="one-half">
<h2>Equities</h2>

<p>The market for active equities trading is broadening to include an ever-larger number of small participants. To serve these smaller customers, banks are rolling out web-based equity trading as an alternative to the traditional approach of heavyweight client-side OMS/EMS installations and FIX connectivity. Caplin has helped both global and regional banks to launch their own equities single-dealer platforms.</p>

<p>The Caplin Core Securities Motif is a ready-made starting point for an equities single-dealer platform, and can be integrated with any equity trading system.</p>

<p>The Core Securities Motif includes current and historic blotters, a market explorer for securities searching and watch-list creation, a market depth display, market and limit order tickets, alerts and allocations.<br />
It gives you complete freedom to rapidly create your own order strategies, while our highly customizable order entry features include support for order slicing, algo execution and FIX ATDL. The unique market explorer feature provides users with comprehensive instrument discovery, capable of searching a database of millions of securities in less than a second.<br />
To enhance your offering further, choose from a range of additional features such as sophisticated charting, trade ideas, research and analytics.</p>
</div>
</div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section-divider">
				<div class="row">
<div class="one-half">
<h2>Futures</h2>

<p>The futures trading community now extends well outside its traditional origins in agriculture, energy and commodities to include participants ranging from large hedge funds to individual retail investors. As the market broadens, highly scalable lightweight web delivery is becoming increasingly important.</p>

<p>Originally created for one of the world&#39;s largest global derivatives brokers, our e-trading solution allows you to have a customized futures e-Commerce offering up and running in a matter of months.</p>

<p>Features available out of the box include intuitive navigation and instrument discovery, quote tiles, heatmaps, charts, multi-function ladders, deal blotters, position management, spreads, option chains, multi-currency account information, account flattening, alerting, and much more.<br />
Caplin&#39;s Professional Services team is always available to help you specify, project manage and develop your own unique trading app based on this foundation. Virtually every aspect of the application&rsquo;s functionality, appearance, content and style can be modified to achieve your vision for a customer-facing web interface.</p>

<p><br />
Caplin&rsquo;s extensible trade model can be configured to support any OTC or exchange traded product. Caplin&rsquo;s integration suite links to any backend OMS/EMS or connectivity hub for direct market access to any venue, either using FIX or via your existing APIs.<br />
The Caplin futures solution is easy to embed as a seamless part of a multi-asset offering.</p>
</div>

<div class="one-half"><img alt="" src="../images/marketing-images/v3/futures-solutions.png" style="max-width: 939px; max-height: 386px;" /></div>

<div class="one-half"><img alt="" src="../images/marketing-images/v3/fixed-income-solutions.png" style="max-width: 742px; max-height: 710px;" /></div>

<div class="one-half">
<h2>Fixed Income</h2>

<p>An avalanche of regulation is bringing about radical changes in the structure of the fixed income markets. The raft of new legislation in the US and Europe in particular is creating a business environment in which a direct online channel is more important than ever for both banks and their clients. Successful sell-side firms will be those that can offer market participants electronic tools to aggregate fragmented liquidity across a range of new venues while managing collateral efficiently.</p>

<p>The Caplin Platform and our fixed income components help you get a fixed income single-dealer platform to market quickly.</p>

<p>Our trading features are based on the best ideas we&rsquo;ve gained from researching and building some of the world&rsquo;s most active fixed income single-dealer platforms.</p>

<p>They include all the elements of a good fixed income trading front end and allow you to offer your customers a range of fixed income products with pre-trade, execution and post-trade capabilities, all within a highly innovative, customizable trading workflow.<br />
Choose from a range of features to provide additional functionality such as blotter export, trade allocation and position compression. For the latest list of available features, contact us.</p>

<p>Caplin reduces overall time-to-market for a fixed income single-dealer platform from an industry average of 1-2 years to, typically, 3-4 months, and reduces the cost by 75% or more.</p>

<p>Caplin&#39;s Professional Services team is always available to work with you to specify, project manage and develop your own unique trading app. The Caplin Fixed Income solution is easy to embed as a seamless part of a multi-asset offering.</p>
</div>
</div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section-divider">
				<div class="row">
<div class="one-half">
<h2>Multi-Asset</h2>

<p>Almost every bank building a single-dealer platform now demands multi-asset capabilities, even if (as is often the case) just a single asset class is implemented initially. Having one technology platform for all your client-facing solutions reduces costs, simplifies your infrastructure, provides an integrated, seamless experience for your customers, and makes it much easier to cross-sell products.</p>

<p>However, it is far from simple to build a single-dealer platform capable of spanning multiple asset classes, and platforms originally designed for specific asset classes can be difficult or impossible to extend. The Caplin Platform was designed from the ground up for multi-asset use, and is already used by major banks around the world to trade FX cash, FX options, structured products, IRDs, equities, commodities, and more. Caplin makes it easy to combine data and deal flow across silos, giving you:</p>

<p>Seamless embedding of the Caplin FX, equities, fixed Income and futures solutions.<br />
The agility to add new products quickly to meet changing business requirements and market conditions.<br />
A ready-made multi-product/multi-asset single-dealer platform strategy, delivering targeted client solutions across the entire risk management and trading lifecycle.<br />
The ability to simply swap out back end components when migrating to new trading systems, without disruption to your users.<br />
Fine-grained user permissioning for different asset classes, products, components, workflows and even individual instruments. This allows you to deliver precisely targeted workflows and pricing to, for example, retail, wealth, corporate and institutional users, internal sales traders and branch networks.</p>

<h2>Custom Development</h2>
<p>Caplin's real-time web technology is suited to building almost any online trading application.</p>

<p>While our busiest market is single-dealer platforms, the massive scalability and power of the Caplin Platform makes it highly effective in a wide range of situations. It has been used to build offerings such as internal dealing screens and sales trading desktops for global banks, retail trading applications, online car auction platforms, stock index distribution systems, and much more.</p>

<p>We offer custom development services to help you to quickly create unique and compelling web applications that will attract, delight and retain customers.</p>

<p>We can take on entire projects and create a bespoke installed solution or managed service built to your exact specification.<br />
Our extensive real-time web platform and powerful development environment enables you to create your own unique applications far more rapidly and at far lower cost than starting from scratch.</p>

<p>Caplin also provides a full range of web trading consultancy services that includes: Training and Certification services, Product Strategy, UX Design, Architecture Design and Agile Project Management.</p>
