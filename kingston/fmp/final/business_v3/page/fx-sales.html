<h2>Caplin FX Sales</h2>

<p>A solution that helps you deliver an outstanding trading experience to your FX sales team.</p>

<p>To build a scalable and cost-effective e-distribution business, banks are migrating clients from high- touch interaction using voice - to high-touch single- dealer platforms. Your sales people face challenges to more effectively manage an increasing number of clients. How do they keep track of individual client needs, monitor their trading activity, pro-actively manage upcoming rollover maturities, and demonstrate value to clients?</p>

<p>When quoting clients on the &#39;phone, it becomes harder for sales people to provide fast, optimal client pricing when they are unfamiliar with the client and the pre-defined margins. This creates greater challenges in meeting the twin objectives of sales profitability, whilst complying with regulatory processes and controls around &lsquo;fair pricing/sales mark-ups&rsquo; for clients. Banks therefore need to invest in systems that will enable sales people to more effectively manage their clients, whilst ensuring they can capture sales-client interactions and identify,</p>

<p>In the past few years there has been a tremendous surge in the rate of growth for mobile technologies. During that time, the amount of internet traffic accessed via mobile devices has increased by a factor of ten. It is undeniable that the mobile trend is continuing to grow and is now spilling into the capital markets, where global and regional banks are now seeking to accommodate client demands for mobile trading solutions that offer real-time pricing and execution services.</p>

<p>Caplin&rsquo;s FX Sales solution addresses challenges faced by sales people and senior management. It provides tools to increase productivty, whilst providing management with the oversight needed to capture, monitor and enforce appropriate sales mark-ups of client trades.</p>

<p>Configurable sales dashboards provide overviews of client trading activity, positions and trading limits. They can also display upcoming maturities and key client metrics. Active client profiles can be saved as &lsquo;favourites&rsquo;, whilst advanced search tools make it easy to identify a client and quickly access metrics needed to service in-bound client calls.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Trading on-behalf of&rsquo; functionality enables sales people to quote and execute trades on behalf of clients, with tickets pre-populated with default client spreads. Sales can lock dealing rates (resulting in variable margin), modify and then lock the applied margin (resulting in variable all-in client rate). Or they can enter the value of the sales mark-up (&lsquo;make me x$&rsquo;) all within pre-defined management limits, thus ensuring clients are quoted appropriate mark-ups for trades done by phone.</p>

<p>Full metrics are captured for all sales-client interactions, providing management with record of actual margins, with the ability to set soft/hard maximum margins, ensuring fair and appropriate client pricing.</p>

<p>Increase your productivity - Implement Caplin&rsquo;s FX Sales, and your sales people will be:</p>
&bull; more efficient due to optimised workflows &bull; able to make better, more profitable deals &bull; easier to track, monitor and oversee ...all whilst increasing revenue and lowering overheads</div>

<h2>Trading for Clients</h2>

<p>The main function of the Caplin FX Sales is to allow sales users to trade on behalf of their clients. This needs to be an efficient workflow providing all the relevant information to the sales user.</p>
Currency Pair Selection Fast and easy currency pair selection with access to recently traded and most frequently traded currency pairs. Spot, Forward &amp; Swaps Trade outright spot and forwards and also even and uneven swaps. Control Margins Full control over margins and client rates including spot rate, forward points, all-in rate, near and far legs. Lock Client Rate The ability to lock the rate while discussing with the client. Live Profit Indicator A visual indication of profit that updates as the underlying trader rate changes. Reset Margin Easily reset margins back to the starting point to recover profit that have eroded as the trader rate changes. Trading for a Client The trading screen focuses on the main activity, giving plenty of room to the specifics of adjusting margins for spots, forwards and swaps. On the right hand side different components can be placed to add further information to help the process of executing &#11;the trade. Adjusting Margins The sales user has full control to adjust the margin on the spot rate and the forward points. The client rate will adjust accordingly as the margin is changed and as the trader rate ticks. Lock Client Rate Once the margins have been set the client rate can be locked. This allows the client rate (spot, points or all-in) to be adjusted without them being affected by the live ticking trader rate. Once the client rate is locked the trade button is enabled and the profit indicator becomes live. Live Profit Indicator With the client rate locked, the trade button and the profit indicator give clear visual information about the sales profit for the pending trade. As the trader rate ticks the sales profit is shown by the profit bar. If the profit drops below the default margin or drops below zero then the trade button highlights as red. Multiple Trades It is possible to add more trades to the screen and work on them concurrently. This allows sales users to setup multiple trades confirm at the same time with the client.</div>
