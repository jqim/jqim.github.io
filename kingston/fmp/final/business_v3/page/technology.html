			<p>If you are developing a new trading GUI, you are faced with an expensive, daunting challenge. Caplin&#39;s solutions slash the cost of building an online trading offering&mdash;often by more than 75%&mdash;and reduce overall time-to-market from an industry average of 1-2 years to, typically, 3-4 months. </p>

			<p>In the past, the time, effort and cost required to create a user interface of even average quality meant that little, if any, resource was left over to add the features and innovations that will differentiate you from your competitors.</p>

			<p>Caplin solutions solve this problem. They provide all the core features found in today&rsquo;s best trading offerings, in a form that is exceptionally easy to style, customise, modify and extend. They give you the freedom to create a trading GUI, limited only by your imagination. </p>

			<p>In addition to core features, Caplin also provides a number of optional feature packs that can be supplied as upgrades, delivering a feature-rich trading offering for an ever-changing, financial market. </p>

			<p>Choosing a Caplin solution means that you instantly have functionality at your fingertips, ready-to-go, right out of the box. This is because, regardless of your target user segment, there is typically a requirement for the same, well-defined set of minimal, marketable trade execution functionalities. The Caplin solutions deliver all of this.</p>

			<p>The solutions are based on Caplin Trader technology, and are exceptionally easy to customise and extend. They work in any modern browser on a desktop or mobile device. And because the solutions are designed to work with the Caplin Platform, they are quick and easy to integrate with your existing backend systems.</p>

			<p>We also offer a comprehensive range of hosting, design and implementation services. We can design and implement your Web trading application in collaboration with your team or if you prefer, supply specific skills as and when required to augment your existing capability. Or we can provide the whole thing as a hosted managed service, via Caplin Direct - our hosted, managed service, for banks that want a custom single-dealer platform, but have previously been held back by the cost and technical challenges involved. </p>

			<p>The blade architecture used by Caplin was specifically developed to remedy this defect. Using the best available open-source libraries and emerging standards, and building on top of these where necessary, blades provide a lightweight and flexible way of building HTML5 applications out of re usable components.</p>

			<p>The blade architecture does not limit what you can build in any way, and is fully compatible with virtually all current HTML5 libraries and tools. It simply offers a set of conventions for componentised development. BladeRunnerJS then provides a great set of tools to help do this efficiently. </p>

<h2>Caplin Technology</h2>

<p>Caplin&#39;s products offer a complete solution specifically designed for web trading. The Caplin solution provides each of the four layers closely integrated for maximum performance and minimum latency. We have implemented our solution in three products - Caplin Trader provides the presentation layer, Caplin Platform provides both the web trading services and distribution layers - there are very clear performance benefits in closely coupling these two layers, and Caplin Integration Suite provides the integration layer.</p>

<p>Caplin Platform can handle financial data from any source. It does this by managing client sessions, (which could be connected from web trading apps or from installed applications), and providing them with real-time access to pricing and trading systems.</p>

<p>The Caplin Platform is an open architecture. It supports a number of different technologies both for developing client applications and for developing integration adapters on the server side. This makes it possible to integrate with mixed technology stacks across multiple departments or teams, and if you change your client technology, you do not have to redevelop the whole technology stack.</p>

<p>The connection between Caplin Platform and Caplin Trader consists of a set of well-defined APIs, so should you require a different presentation solution, or even a different distribution engine, then we can accommodate your needs.</p>

<p>Caplin technology is highly scalable and performant; it uses best of breed technologies at each level - where they already existed we used, enhanced or extended them, and where they didn&#39;t exist, we&#39;ve built them.</p>

<p>Advanced trading GUIs of the kind built on the Caplin platform are among the most complex applications ever built in HTML5, and developing applications of this type reveals shortcomings in the conventional JavaScript programming model.</p>

<p>In particular, there is no inbuilt support for componentisation, resulting in &lsquo;spaghetti&rsquo; code in which everything depends on everything else. This works for smaller apps, but is very hard to maintain for enterprise-scale apps. The result is reduced developer productivity, high project costs and code that can be very hard to maintain and enhance.</p>

<h2>Caplin Trader</h2>

<p>Based on pure HTML5 technology, Caplin Trader provides sophisticated ready-to-run trading front ends for a range of asset classes, with tools that make it easy to style, brand, modify and extend these. It also includes BladeRunner, the world&rsquo;s most powerful HTML5 framework for developing your own HTML5 trading components and solutions.</p>

<p>Caplin Trader is designed to run on top of the Caplin Platform, which provides advanced web trading services to support the front end functionality. Caplin Trader also allows you to create a customised, high-end web trading app faster and more reliably than any other solution - and at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p><strong>Pre built solutions</strong></p>

<p>Designed for use with Caplin Trader and the Caplin Platform, the Caplin Motifs are a ready-made starting point for a single-dealer platform, and can be integrated with any trading system.</p>

<p>Caplin&#39;s Motifs gets you to market fast with a state-of-the-art single-dealer platform, while still giving you unlimited freedom to customize and enhance your offering.</p>

<p>Understand more about how Caplin Motifs works in our developers site.</p>

<h2>Caplin Platform</h2>

<p>The Caplin Platform is a high-performance service-orientated real-time web-trading framework.</p>

<p>It includes all the basic functionality offered by generic streaming servers, but in addition has been specifically designed to handle bi-directional real-time price and trading messages. It offers features such as fine-grained adaptive flow control, dynamic list management, real-time permissioning, subject-based routing and continuous latency monitoring.</p>

<p>The Caplin Platform also provides many specific services to support advanced trading functionality in thin-client applications. For example, it offers very fast on-demand dynamic filtering and sorting of long instrument or trade lists, and &ldquo;paging&rdquo; (lazy-loading) of the result to the client. This supports the user experience of scrolling through thousands of rows of real-time data, without incurring the crippling overhead of sending data that is not in view.</p>

<p>Designed from the ground up for financial trading applications, the Caplin Platform is massively scalable and provides all the performance, security and reliability that users expect for high-end trading. Twelve years of continuous development have been devoted to ensuring that it provides the same quality of service over the internet as can be achieved over a private line.</p>

<p>The Caplin Platform provides data normalisation and an anti-corruption layer that leaves you free to implement the best solution for your customers, independent of the underlying trading and pricing systems. Both the web delivery and the back-end systems can then be changed or enhanced at any time without either affecting the other.</p>

<p>Caplin Platform consists of:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Caplin Liberator:</strong> An ultra-high-performance real-time financial internet hub that delivers data and messages in to and from subscribers over any network<br />
<strong>Caplin Transformer:</strong> An event-driven real-time data transformation engine that is optimised for web trading services, which are implemented via Transformer Modules<br />
<strong>Caplin KeyMaster:</strong> A security tool that integrates the Caplin Platform with any web-based authentication or single sign-on system<br />
<strong>Caplin Director:</strong> A user administration system that can optionally be used as an alternative to integration with an existing database<br />
<strong>Integration Adapters:</strong> Interface applications that allow existing applications such as pricing, trading and permissioning systems to communicate with the Caplin Platform. Caplin provides standard Integration Adapters for a number of systems, and a toolkit that makes it easy to build custom ones using the Caplin Integration Suite<br />
<strong>Caplin Management Console:</strong> An admin GUI that allows you to monitor and control all components of the Caplin Platform (including custom Integration Adapters)</p>

<p>The Caplin Platform can be enhanced by the addition of Caplin Platform Blades, discrete modules of functionality that implement adapters, configuration or services. A Caplin Platform Blade is often matched with a Caplin Trader Blade to provide particular data or services to the end-user.</p>

<p>For development purposes, the Caplin Platform is supported on Linux, Microsoft Windows and MacOS. It is deployed on Linux.</p>

<p>Understand more about how Caplin Platform works in our developers site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Caplin Integration Suite</h2>

<p>The Caplin Integration Suite (CIS) is a set of APIs and tools for creating adapters that integrate the Caplin Platform with your back-end systems to enable the presentation of relevant information and services to your front-end application. CIS also includes the Caplin Blade Toolkit, which enables you to create, build and export Caplin Platform Blades.</p>
