            <p><span>Almost every bank building a single-dealer platform now demands multi-asset capabilities, even if (as is often the case) just a single asset class is implemented initially. Having one technology platform for all your client-facing solutions reduces costs, simplifies your infrastructure, provides an integrated, seamless experience for your customers, and makes it much easier to cross-sell products.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span>However, it is far from simple to build a single-dealer platform capable of spanning multiple asset classes, and platforms originally designed for specific asset classes can be difficult or impossible to extend.
